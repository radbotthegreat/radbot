So you want to extend radbot by writing your own plugin(s). Excellent!

radbot does not and will not keep track of the activities of its
plugins.

The first thing to remember is that the plugin had to reside under
$HOME/radbot/radbot-plugins/. This means that if your plugin is called
fribitz, it will reside under $HOME/radbot/radbot-plugins/fribitz/

The second thing to remember is that you will have to specify it in
$HOME/plugins-list
