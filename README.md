radbot is a process automation framework. radbot is a rewrite of a
project that has been in continuous use at Red Hat Inc since 2008.

In its previous avatar called f{u,oo}bar, radbot has been in
continuous use at Red Hat for over 9 years. It was an essential part
of global support operations, to download, extract and automate
diagnostics of customer data. It was also used to auto-delete customer
data when the data was no longer needed - thus enforcing a data
retention policy.

radbot's immediate use-case is to automate the extraction of archives
and run automated diagnostic utilities on them. But radbot offers much
more.

No Red Hat intellectual property can be found in radbot. Permissions
for public release of this code, under GPL v3 have been obtained from
my former employer, Red Hat Inc.
